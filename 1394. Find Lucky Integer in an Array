Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return the largest lucky integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.

class Solution(object):
    def findLucky(self, arr):
        luckyNumbers = []
        frequency = {}
        #We create a dictionary, and iterate over our array, and for each element, calculate
        #and its frequency in arr to the dictionary.
        for num in arr:
            if num in frequency:
                frequency[num] += 1
            else:
                frequency[num] = 1
        #We then iterate over our dictionary, and if any number from the array is equal to its 
        #frequency, it must be a lucky number. We then add it to the array of luckyNumbers.
        for num, freq in frequency.items():
            if num == freq:
                luckyNumbers.append(num)
        #We then return the largest lucky number, if one exists, otherwise we return -1.
        if luckyNumbers:
            return max(luckyNumbers)
        else:
            return -1
