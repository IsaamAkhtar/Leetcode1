Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


#Turn the array of ints into a set to get rid of duplicate elements
        mySet = set(nums)
        #Iterate through the set for every element
        for i in mySet:
            #If the number of the current element in the array is a majority element as defined,
            #return it
            if nums.count(i) > len(nums) / 2:
                return i
