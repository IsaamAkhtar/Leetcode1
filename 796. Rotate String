Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false

class Solution(object):
    def rotateString(self, s, goal):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type goal: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        #Check if the lengths of the strings are the same, and if s is in "2 goals" combined.
        #This will show if s can be made into the goal by shifting it.
        return len(s) == len(goal) and s in goal+goal
