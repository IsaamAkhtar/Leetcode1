You are given two arrays nums1 and nums2 consisting of positive integers.

You have to replace all the 0's in both arrays with strictly positive integers such that the sum of elements of both arrays becomes equal.

Return the minimum equal sum you can obtain, or -1 if it is impossible.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [3,2,0,1,0], nums2 = [6,5,0]
Output: 12
Explanation: We can replace 0's in the following way:
- Replace the two 0's in nums1 with the values 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums1 = [3,2,2,1,4].
- Replace the 0 in nums2 with the value 1. The resulting array is nums2 = [6,5,1].
Both arrays have an equal sum of 12. It can be shown that it is the minimum sum we can obtain.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,0,2,0], nums2 = [1,4]
Output: -1

class Solution:
    def minSum(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        zeros1 = 0
        sum1 = 0
        zeros2 = 0
        sum2 = 0
        #Iterate through each loop, get its sum, and count the number of zeros, replacing each with  1
        for num in nums1:
            zeros1 += 1 if num == 0 else 0
            sum1 += num
        for num in nums2:
            zeros2 += 1 if num == 0 else 0
            sum2 += num
        sum1 += zeros1
        sum2 += zeros2

        if(zeros1 == 0 and sum2 > sum1) or (zeros2 == 0 and sum1 > sum2):
            return -1
        return max(sum1, sum2)
