You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.


class Solution(object):
    def dominantIndex(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        largestInt = max(nums)
        indexOfLargest = nums.index(largestInt)
        #Enumerate through the array, keeping track of both the index and the value
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            #If we get a value that isn't the largest and is greater then the largest,
            #we return -1
            if i != indexOfLargest and num * 2 > largestInt:
                return -1
        #Otherwise, return the index
        return indexOfLargest
