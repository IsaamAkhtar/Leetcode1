class Solution(object):
    def removeVowels(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        #Make a list of all the characters in the string, if they are not vowels.
        myList = [char for char in s if char not in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']]
        #Turn the list make into a string.
        answer = ''.join(myList)
