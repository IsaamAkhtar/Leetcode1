Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.
 
 class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        #Split up the string into words
        words = s.split()
        #Get the last word of the string
        lastWord = words[-1]
        #Return its length
        return len(lastWord)
