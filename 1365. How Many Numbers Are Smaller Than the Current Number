Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

 class Solution(object):
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        answer = []
        #Nested for-loops, to iterate through a element with one, and to check it against
        #every other element. If any other elements are found to be less then it, then
        #the counter is incremented, finally the answer 
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            counter = 0 
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                    if i != j and nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        counter += 1
            answer.append(counter)
        return answer
