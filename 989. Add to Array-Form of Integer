The array-form of an integer num is an array representing its digits in left to right order.

For example, for num = 1321, the array form is [1,3,2,1].
Given num, the array-form of an integer, and an integer k, return the array-form of the integer num + k.

 
 class Solution(object):
    def addToArrayForm(self, num, k):
        """
        :type num: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        #Convert the array-form into a integer by mapping each number in nums into a string,
        #joining them, then turning that string into an integer.
        numInt = int(''.join(map(str, num)))
        #Setting our answer equal to the sum of the array-form integer and k.
        answerInt = numInt + k
        #Turning our new sum back into a array and returning it.
        answer = [int(digit) for digit in str(answerInt)]
        return answer
