Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

class Solution(object):
    def sortedSquares(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        #Make a list of the answer, with each value in nums replaced with its square, sort it,
        #then return it.
        answer = [num * num for num in nums]
        answer.sort()
        return answer
