Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

class Solution(object):
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        #We create a dictionary to store the occurrences
        occurrences = {}
        #For each number in the array, we set occurences at num to the current count. We 
        #increment the count by 1 if it is already in the dictionary.
        for num in arr:
            occurrences[num] = occurrences.get(num, 0) + 1
        #We create  set, to get rid of duplicates.
        unique_counts = set(occurrences.values())
        #Whether or not the lengths of the dictionary and the set are equal or not.
        return len(occurrences) == len(unique_counts)
