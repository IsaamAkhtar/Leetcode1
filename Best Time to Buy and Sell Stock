You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

#We assume that we buy at the first possible day.
        buyingDay = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        #Iterate through each day in the array
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            #If the previously saved price is greater then the current, we let that be our new 
            #current buying date
            if (buyingDay > prices[i]):
                buyingDay = prices[i]
            #Else if the current price minus the previously saved one is greater then the profit,
            #we set the profit equal to the difference of the current and the previous
            elif(prices[i] - buyingDay > profit):
                profit = prices[i] - buyingDay
        return profit
