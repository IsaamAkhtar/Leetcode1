You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        #Two counters, to count frequencies.
        countS = Counter(s)
        countT = Counter(t)
        #Find the added letter with a frequency of 1 in t.
        for char, count in countT.items():
            if countS[char] != count:
                return char
