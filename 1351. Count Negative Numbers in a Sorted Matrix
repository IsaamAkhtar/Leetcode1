Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

 

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0

class Solution(object):
    def countNegatives(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        #Initialise a variable for the count of negatives.
        negCount = 0
        #Loop through each row in the matrix.
        for row in grid:
            #Loop through each index in the row.
            for index in row:
                #If a negative is found, increment the count of negatives.
                if index <= -1:
                    negCount += 1
        return negCount
