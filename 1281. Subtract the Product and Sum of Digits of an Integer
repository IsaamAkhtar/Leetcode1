Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

class Solution(object):
    def subtractProductAndSum(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        #Turn the integer into a list.
        digitList = [int(digit) for digit in str(n)]
        myProduct = 1
        #Get the sum of the digits.
        for integer in digitList:
            mySum = sum(digitList)
        #Get the products of the digits.
        for num in digitList:
            myProduct *= num
        #Return the different of the product and the sum.
        return myProduct - mySum
