Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        #We sort both strings and check to see if they are equal, if not
        #we return false, as they cannot be anagrams. Otherwise, they are anagrams,
        #and we return true. 
        if sorted(s) != sorted(t):
            return False
        else:
            return True
