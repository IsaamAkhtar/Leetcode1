Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

class Solution(object):
    def sortArrayByParity(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        #Make lists for both the even and odd numbers.
        evenList = []
        oddList = []
        #Loop through the array, check the parity of each value, and append it to 
        #the appropriate list.
        for i in nums:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                evenList.append(i)
            else:
                oddList.append(i)
        #Add the lists and return them.
        return evenList + oddList
