Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: false

        #A power of two has only one bit set to 1, so we can use the bitwise AND with (n - 1)
        #to check if n is a power of two.
        return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
