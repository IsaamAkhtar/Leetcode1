A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation:
Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".

Example 3:
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aab"
Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".

        secondLast = None
        #Iterate through the string, if the current character is not equal to the two before it,
        #we append it to the answer, and reassign the values of the last and second last
        #characters, moving them forwards.
        for ch in s:
            if ch != last or ch != secondLast:
                result += ch
                secondLast = last
                last = ch
