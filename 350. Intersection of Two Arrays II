Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.

class Solution(object):
    def intersect(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        #Initialize a array to hold the answer, and a counter to keep track
        #of the count of each element in the given array.
        counter = Counter(nums1)
        answer = []
        #Iterate through the second given array.
        for num in nums2:
            #If we find a element in both, we append it to the answer.
            if num in counter and counter[num] > 0:
                answer.append(num)
                #Decrement the count of that element.
                counter[num] -= 1
        return answer
