Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]


class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        #Initialize left and right pointers.
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        #Reverse until the pointers "meet".
        while left < right:
            #Swap the characters.
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            #Move the pointers towards the center.
            right -= 1
            left += 1
